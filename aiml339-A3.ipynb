    "## Matrix Profiles for Anomaly Detection and Time Series Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix profile is primarily used to find repeating patterns and outliers in a single, univariate time series.. This is based on the principle of similarity joins - comparing a sub-sequence of the time series against itself, by computing the distance between each pair of subsequences. Matrix profile algorithms have the following properties:\n",
    "- Domain agnostic\n",
    "- Can be exact or approximate\n",
    "- Only one hyperparameter (window length)\n",
    "- Parallelizable\n",
    "- Stream compatible\n",
    "- Handles missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms:\n",
    "- **Motif**: A repeated pattern in the time series.\n",
    "- **Discord**: An anomaly in the time series.\n",
